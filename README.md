# Welcome

Hello :)

This is repo containing all codes made while  
reading Algorithms Unlocked" by Thomas Cormen.  
All codes will be written in JS, but if you think  
you might need something from there just grab it.  
If you see some possible improvements just create an  
issue - thank you in advance <3

Enjoy!

# Side info

- folders === book chapters
- in chapter 1 there were no code examples, so no folder for it
- this functions will work properly ONLY with numbers
- I am ommiting all type checking process
- above two steps lets me focus purely on algorithmic side to understand them better
- -1 will be default error return for functions that would return number
